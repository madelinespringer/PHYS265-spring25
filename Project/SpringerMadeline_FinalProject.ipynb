    "### 1: name of the package, describe what is the basic aim of what the package does or solve?\n",
    "The name of this package is emcee and it is a Python package for conducting Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling. It is usually used for Bayesian inference which is a method of statistical inference where you calculate the probability of a hypothesis based on prior information and then it updates as new information becomes available. Emcee estimates the distribution of model parameters based on this information instead of producing a single best-fit value."

Whether or not I use emcee at my internship after completing this, I know it will be useful for any form of parameter estimation with uncertainty and provide me with a better understanding of Python."

    "Emcee was first released around 2012 and developed by Dan Foreman-Mackey and several other collaborators. It is inspired by the affine-invariant ensemble sampler method which was created by Goodman and Weare in 2010. There are other tools that do similar things like PyMC3 and PyMC which let you build more complex Bayesian models, Stan and pystan which are powerful but harder to use, and dynesty which is another newer MCMC tool. All these tools solve the same kinds of problems: figuring out uncertain model parameters."

    "Below are two examples of how you can use emcee. The first example comes directly from emcee's page on GitHub (which can be found at https://emcee.readthedocs.io/en/v3.1.3/). It samples from a 5-dimensional multivariate Gaussian and defines the log-probability directly in terms of the parameters without using any real data. It's good for testing and understanding the mechanics of this sampler. The second is a real world example of how you can use emcee to fit noisy data to a straight line (y = mx + b). It defines a likelihood function based on the Gaussian noise model and uses priors to define the parameter space before creating a corner plot to show the distributions. This example demonstrates how emcee is helpful in data analysis."

Then, in the bottom left, the plot demonstrates the relationship between the slope and intercept in the posterior distribution. Each dot is one sample from the MCMC sampler and the contours show regions of equal probability density (darker = more likely, lighter = less likely). The tighter and smaller the contours, the less uncertainty is present. As for the tilt, it means that slope and intercept are correlated so if you change one slightly, you can change the other to compensate and try to preserve the fit. The more circular the contours are, the more independent your parameters are. "
